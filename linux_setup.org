* Linux Machine Config
I am attempting to setup a linux machine using an entirely literate config,
manage through org-mode files. My goal is to have several org files, with code
that is tangled to the appropriate locations.

This is still very much a work in progress.

** Package Installation
In order to get my literate config files onto a new machine and run them, I'll
need git and emacs at least. So I figure why not handle package installs before
we get into the org-mode stuff.

I keep the packages I want to install in =packages.txt=:

#+begin_src shell :tangle "~/packages.txt"
pass
git
curl
tmux
zsh
htop
silversearcher-ag
qutebrowser
emacs26
xclip
fonts-powerline
#+end_src

I have a short bash script to handle the installation:
#+begin_src shell :tangle "~/ubuntu_setup.sh"
 #!/bin/bash

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs

sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y $(cat ~/packages.txt | awk '{print $1}')
sudo apt autoremove -y

curl -L git.io/antigen > antigen.zsh

setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps
chsh -s $(which zsh)
#+end_src
** Git Config
Set up my user name and email address for git.
#+begin_src yaml :tangle "~/.gitconfig"
[user]
  email = srpillsworth@gmail.com
  name = Sam Pillsworth
#+end_src

* Plans
** TODO better lock screen
** TODO still getting some unknown characters in terminal
** TODO window management
